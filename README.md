# COVID-19 Data Analysis (2020)

> Academic data analysis project using real-world COVID-19 data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation of global COVID-19 data from the year 2020. The analysis uses a publicly available Kaggle dataset to examine trends in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases across countries and regions. The focus of this project is on descriptive analysis and visual insights rather than predictive modelling or machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle — COVID-19 Analysis, Visualization & Comparisons
- **Time Period:** 2020
- **Coverage:** Global (country and region-level data)
- **Key Variables:**
  - Confirmed cases
  - Deaths
  - Recovered cases
  - Active cases
  - New daily cases, deaths, and recoveries
  - Derived metrics such as death rate and recovery rate

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To explore and summarise global COVID-19 data from 2020
- To identify trends and patterns in case counts, mortality, and recovery rates
- To compare COVID-19 impacts across different countries and regions
- To visualise key findings using clear and informative plots
- To support data-driven understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic

## 🔍 Methodology
The analysis follows a structured data analysis workflow:
1. Data description and understanding
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Trend and comparative analysis
5. Data visualisation
6. Interpretation of results and limitations
